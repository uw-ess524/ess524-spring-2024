1. Describe the subject area of your chosen application in general terms.
What are the important fields and what do domain scientists want to do with them?
What observations are available of these fields?
What would be a typical space and time scale for a simulation in this domain?
2. Write down the entire cast of characters -- field names, symbols, units, and tensor rank.
3. What are the governing conservation laws for the system?
What are the inputs and outputs and where do the inputs and outputs reside in the earth system?
4. What are the important constitutive relations?
Which pairs of fields do they relate?
Are the constitutive relations derivable from first principles or are they empirical?
5. Write down the full variational form of the system of equations that you intend to solve and label every term.
6. Are the dynamics of the system that you're interested in more dissipative or wave-like / energy-conservative?
7. Which terms are hard to deal with and which ones are easy?
Are there regimes in which one or the other character dominates?
8. Describe the space and time discretization that you will use and why you chose them.
9. Pick a test case, either real or synthetic, and describe it.
What is the geometry?
What are the inputs?
What is the initial state?
10. What sanity checks can you use to get a better idea of whether you implemented everything correctly or not?
11. What features of the real physical system does this test case demonstrate?
What can we learn about the physics through this exercise?
12. What was the most error-prone part of writing this simulation?
13. If you were given another quarter to work on this, what additional physics would you add to this simulation and why?
Would the addition of this extra physics require substantial changes to your numerical approach?
If so, how?
