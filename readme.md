# ESS524

This is the repo for UW ESS524, Numerical heat and mass flow modeling.
The `demo/` directory contains all the assignments, which are jupyter notebooks.

### Evaluation

I'm changing some things about this class; software has changed a lot since it was initially developed.
So this is going to be a bit of an experiment.
The evaluation will be:
* 50% for doing the demo notebooks
* 50% for the final project

I ask that you attempt each demo notebook when assigned.
It doesn't have to be finished and your code doesn't have to be perfect.
I'll review them before the next class, then we'll go over them, talk about what you did and didn't get, and finish them.

Hand in your own work but feel free to work on the assignments together.


### Project

The final project is to pick a modeling problem in the discipline of your choice and write a numerical simulation of it.
Preferably this is a problem or test case from a published paper or book that you can add something to.
See the `final-project.md` document for a complete description.
You can work in groups.
We'll have lots of check-ins throughout the quarter and I'll help you refine it to something reasonable.


### Computing

The language of instruction will be Python.
The requirements at first are to be able to run a Jupyter notebook server and a Python IDE that you're comfortable with.
If you don't have all this set up already, I'm happy to help you do it.
Later, we'll use Docker, so this is worth installing ahead of time.


### AI

As with any resource, if you use an AI assistant to write any code in the assignments, cite it.
Preferably send in the complete prompt and responses.
In my experience these tools work well to save time on some coding tasks (how do I get the permutation that sorts a list again...) but tend to make things up on deeper questions.
I asked ChatGPT "What are collocation methods for ordinary differential equations?" and the answer had several factual errors.
