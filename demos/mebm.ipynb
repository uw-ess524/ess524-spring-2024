    "## Energy balance models\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration is based on *energy balance models*.\n",
    "Specifically, we will be looking at three different papers:\n",
    "* [North et al. (1981), Energy balance climate models](https://doi.org/10.1029/RG019i001p00091)\n",
    "* [Flannery (1984), Energy Balance Models Incorporating Transport of Thermal and Latent Energy](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041<0414:EBMITO>2.0.CO;2)\n",
    "* [Roe et al. (2015), The remote impacts of climate feedbacks on regional climate predictability](https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2346)\n",
    "\n",
    "These models aim to describe how the temperature distribution $T$ of the earth varies with latitude, averaging over any variation in the longitudinal direction.\n",
    "They include at least three effects:\n",
    "* Latitudinal transport of heat, which we assume is diffusive.\n",
    "* Absorption of solar radiation, which depends on both insolation and the albedo or reflectivity of the earth.\n",
    "* Emittance of longwave radiation from earth, which is temperature-dependent through the [Planck law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the most simplified version of each of these effects and then build up in complexity.\n",
    "A word of warning: the paper by Flannery prefers to describe spatial dependence of the coefficients in the problem as polynomials in $x$, while the paper by North and others prefers to describe spatial dependence in terms of Legendre polynomials.\n",
    "You may have to convert back and forth at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Net balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The total balance equation states that the flow of heat into and out of a given latitude band has to be balanced by the sum of heat energy coming in and heat energy lost to space.\n",
    "If $F$ is the heat flux, then the conservation form of our problem is\n",
    "$$F(x_2) - F(x_1) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2}(a\\cdot S - I)dx$$\n",
    "where $S$ is the solar radiation hitting the earth, $I$ is the emission of longwave radiation.\n",
    "The coalbedo $a$ dictates how much of the solar radiation is actually absorbed; some will be reflected.\n",
    "**Exercise**: derive the differential and variational forms of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diffusive transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than use the latitude itself as the coordinate, these models use the sine of the latitude, which we'll write as $x$.\n",
    "This choice of coordinate system means that the expressions for differential operators have to change.\n",
    "First, the easy part: if $F$ is the heat flux, then\n",
    "$$\\nabla\\cdot F = \\frac{dF}{dx}.$$\n",
    "The challenging part is what has to happen to the temperature gradient:\n",
    "$$\\nabla T = (1 - x^2)\\frac{dT}{dx}.$$\n",
    "Again, this extra factor of $1 - x^2$ is because of the transformation to spherical coordinates.\n",
    "We'll assume at first that the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient:\n",
    "$$F = -D\\nabla T$$\n",
    "for some constant coefficient $D$.\n",
    "In real applications, we obtain this coefficient by fitting to a combination of global circulation model output and remote sensing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating heat transport as diffusive is a huge simplification of the general circulation of the ocean and atmosphere.\n",
    "These simplified models nonetheless have their uses in describing the bulk behavior of the climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outgoing longwave radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The earth loses heat to space by emission of infrared or longwave radiation.\n",
    "The hotter the earth surface is, the more energetic the longwave emissions.\n",
    "The magnitude of the longwave emissions and their temperature sensitivity can be estimated from observational data, giving\n",
    "$$I(T) = A + BT$$\n",
    "where A = 203.3 W/m${}^2$ and B = 2.09 W/(m${}^2\\; {}^{\\circ}$C).\n",
    "Quoting North et al. 1981, these coefficients are effectively including many complex processes including clouds, infrared-absorbing gases, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incoming shortwave radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The earth gains heat from solar radiation, but some amount of this radiation is reflected back to space.\n",
    "We can approximate the solar input by a parabola (equation 3 in Flannery):\n",
    "$$S(x) = Q(s_0 - s_2x^2)$$\n",
    "where Q = 334 W/m${}^2$, s${}_0$ = 1.246, and s${}_2$ = 0.738.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to prescribe the co-albedo $a$; the total heat absorbed is equal to $a\\cdot S$.\n",
    "For starters, we can take observed values (equation 18 in North et al, converted to the monomial basis):\n",
    "$$a(x) = a_0 - a_2x^2$$\n",
    "where a${}_0$ = 0.782, a${}_2$ = 0.303.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the interesting physics is wrapped up in the co-albedo.\n",
    "In particular, the co-albedo is much lower over icy surfaces than over land or ocean -- in other words, $a$ really depends on $T$, which makes the problem nonlinear.\n",
    "We'll start with the observed values first and then work our way to the nonlinear case."
