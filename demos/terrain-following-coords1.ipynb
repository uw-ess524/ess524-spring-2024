    "One key observation.\n",
    "When we take a partial derivative of some field with respect to $x_1$, we do so with with the vertical coordinate $x_3$ held fixed.\n",
    "But when we take a partial derivative of a field with respect to $\\xi_1$, we do so with the *relative depth* $\\xi_3$ held fixed, and those two are not the same thing because of variations in the surface and bed topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're talking about derivatives of the bed elevation and thickness, however, those fields only depend on the horizontal coordinates, which are unchanged.\n",
    "Consequently we can unambigously write $\\nabla b$ or $\\nabla h$ without having to specify which coordinate system we're working with.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Volume distortion\n",

    "First, we can work out how volumes get distorted and how this changes the integrals we need to compute.\n",
