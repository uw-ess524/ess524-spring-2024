    "# Groundwater hydrology\n",
    "\n",
    "This example comes from exercises 4.2.1-4.2.3 of the book *Inverse Problems in Groundwater Modeling* by Ne-Zhung Sun.\n",
    "Here we are interested in the flow of groundwater in a saturated aquifer.\n",
    "The conserved quantity is water mass, and the field we are solving for is the *hydraulic head* $h$.\n",
    "The hydraulic head has units of length; if we were to drill into the aquifer, the hydraulic head is how far up the borehole the groundwater would rise to.\n",
    "In a saturated porous medium, the hydraulic head is greater or equal to the thickness $H$ of the aquifer itself.\n",
    "Later we'll look at unsaturated porous media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relation between the actual volume of water stored per unit volume of the porous medium is quantified in a coefficient called the *storativity* $S$.\n",
    "Using the notation from class, our extensive density $G$ is water volume per unit footprint area, and the relation between the extensive density and the field to be solved for is\n",
    "$$G = S\\cdot h.$$\n",
    "In some media, the storativity itself depends on the hydraulic head, but we'll assume it's a constant for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we're going to use a 2D setup in the $x$ and $y$ directions.\n",
    "We'll use a set of equations for groundwater flow that assume some depth-averaging so that the vertical dependence is ignorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Darcy's law* states that the flux of water through the aquifer is proportional to the gradient in hydraulic head:\n",
    "$$F = -KH\\nabla h$$\n",
    "where $H$ is the aquifer thickness and $K$ is the *hydraulic conductivity* of the porous medium, which has units of length / time.\n",
    "The hydraulic conductivity measures the ease with which water can percolate through the medium; sand and gravel have high conductivities, clays very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources $q$ of water come from infiltration from above, say from rainwater, while the sinks are loss of water to an aquifer below or direct pumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational form\n",

    "| Water sources | $Q$ | length / time\n",
    "| External fluxes | $f$ | length${}^2$ / time\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting everything together, the variational form of the problem is to find the hydraulic head $h$ for which\n",
    "$$\\int_\\Omega\\left(S\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}\\phi + KH\\nabla h\\cdot\\nabla\\phi - Q\\phi\\right)dx - \\int_{\\Gamma_N} f\\,d\\gamma = 0$$\n",
    "for all test functions $\\phi$.\n",
    "Here $\\Gamma_N$ denotes the segment of the boundary where there are external fluxes.\n",
    "On the remaining part $\\Gamma_D$ of the domain boundary, we impose a fixed value of the hydraulic head:\n",
    "$$h|_{\\Gamma_D} = h_{\\text{ext}}$$\n",
    "Remember that fixed or proportional fluxes are *natural* boundary conditions (we incorporate them into the variational form) while Dirichlet conditions are *essential* (we have to modify the linear system and test functions)."
