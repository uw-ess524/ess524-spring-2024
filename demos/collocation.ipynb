    "For linear ODEs whose coefficients do not depend on time, if we have an eigendecomposition of the system matrix, we can compute the solution.\n",
    "That's all fine and good but many interesting problems are nonlinear or depend on time.\n",
    "Moreover, while the eigendecomposition is useful as a conceptual tool and for evaluating how well solvers work on solvable test cases, it is difficult to compute especially for large systems.\n",
    "We can't expect to solve general ODEs exactly because the objects of interest to us are trajectories or functions, and it takes infinitely many numbers to describe a function with complete exactness.\n",
    "The best we can do is approximate.\n",
    "Here we'll look at a very effective family of methods for approximating solutions of ODE.\n",
    "First, we'll motivate things with a thought experiment."

    "The simplest collocation method assumes that, in each sub-interval, the approximate solution is a linear function, and we have to determine the coefficients.\n",
    "**The idea of collocation is to pick a finite set of points and make the ODE exact at those points.**\n",
    "This will give us a system of equations to solve for the coefficients in the basis expansion.\n",

    "We'll assume for all of the collocation methods that we define (degree-1 or higher) that the approximate solution is a continuous function.\n",
    "In the degree-1 case, we can assume that there is a single degree-of-freedom $\\hat{u}_n$ for each knot point $t_k$.\n",
    "We can then define the approximation by linear interpolation within each cell.\n",
    "If $t$ lies in the interval $[t_n, t_{n + 1}]$, then we can define the re-mapped time\n",
    "$$\\tau = (t - t_n) / \\delta t_n$$\n",
    "as the fractional duration of $t$ through the interval $[t_n, t_{n + 1}]$; the nice part about working with this variable is that $\\tau$ is always in the interval $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "We then define $u$ within this interval as\n",
    "$$u(t_n + \\tau\\,\\delta t_n) = (1 - \\tau)\\hat u_n + \\tau\\hat u_{n + 1}$$\n",
    "and piece together these linear segments to define $u$ over the entire interval $[0, T]$.\n",
    "This choice only requires $N + 1$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "If this feels a little silly or basic now, it'll make more sense when we get to higher-order collocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we were given some initial conditions, so we can state right away that\n",
    "$$\\hat u_0 = u|_{t = 0}.$$\n",
    "Now let's suppose that we've determined the coefficients $\\hat u_0, \\ldots, \\hat u_n$, and we now want to compute $\\hat u_{n + 1}$.\n",
    "The collocation condition is that the differential equation is exact at some time point $\\tau_*$ between $t_n$ and $t_{n + 1}$.\n",
