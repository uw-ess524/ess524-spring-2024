    "Remember early on in the heady days of the pandemic when everyone was discovering what exponential growth was?\n",

    "For example, say we were looking at the growth of cyanobacteria on the surface of a lake, and $p$ represents the number of cells in the water column per unit centimeter squared.\n",
    "Once the population reaches its carrying capacity $p_c$, the population will fall back down.\n",
    "Likewise, if we look at the population of some herbivorous species like rabbits or deer, the environment only supports so much available food.\n",
    "Consequently, we might imagine that the growth rate slows multiplicatively as the population approaches capacity:\n",
    "$$\\dot p = \\tau^{-1}p\\cdot\\left(1 - \\frac{p}{p_c}\\right).$$\n",
    "This is called the **logistic equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00483-1) which showed that some lakes have carrying capacities $p_c$ on the order of 10 mm${}^3$ / L and [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-023-02035-z) which tabulated growth timescales $\\tau$ on the order of 12h for some species at optimal conditions.\n",
